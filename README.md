# Project-one
project one
•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I made a clock that will read am, pm, and show a 2400-hour time


•	What did you do particularly well?
Was able to make the code read through and give the correct time.
•	Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could have made it a live clock, so it show the time in real time.


•	Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The hardiest part was to make the 24-hour time. I was able to read the material in Brightside and zybooks. 


•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Doing the functions and being able to grab code from different areas of the script. 


•	How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I just followed the directions, and separated the code based on it function. If the code was not the same, or belonged, I added spaces, which made it more readable.
